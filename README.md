# Computability and algorithm, task 8: Regular Grammars and Finite Automatons.
### By Basilio GÃ³mez Navarro. November, 2019.

## The program:
 - The program reads a ".gra" input file with the description of a Grammar
   and generates a ".nfa" file with the NFA specification resulting from convert

## How to use the program:
  - The program is called "G2NFA", so to excute it:
   ./G2NFA [inputFile.nfa] [outputFile.dfa]
  - If the program is executed  without parameters, it  will show a small
    message explaning how to run the program.
  - Also the "--help" parameter is aviable, so if you execute ./G2NFA --help"
    a unix-style help message will be displayed, detailing how to run the
    program correctly.
